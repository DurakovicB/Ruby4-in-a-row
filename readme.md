# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players take turns dropping tokens into a vertically suspended grid. Whichever player manages to **connect 4 tokens** of the same token horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

The project was done as part of the **IT 305 Programming Languages** course at International Burch University, and implemented in the **Ruby** programming language.
